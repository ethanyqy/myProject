# Experience at Newfiber
From Sept 2020 to Dec 2020

# Backgounds
The team built predict models for water quality related analysis.
The predict models were generated from machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, neural network, etc.
Some data are geographic data. GIS is needed to extract the data.
Then use Python to do data cleansing and model building.

# Build predict model with SVM algorithm
Given data are quantity of rain, rate of flow.
Manipulate data to fit the SVM model
Train and do validation. Give report about the prediction

# Data manipulation and cleanse
Given satellite pictures of lake.
Use QGIS to get the data of spectrum and use python to clean the data.
Calculate the data of spectrum to get the data of water quality

# Scripts

## prediction_for_Baqu
build predict model with SVM algorithm for Baqu River analysis

## 1.2.3.4.5.
give analysis about the water quality of Deyang Lake
