# Experience at Longxing Keystone
From Jan 2021 to Apr 2021

# Backgounds
The main project of the team was to develop a software for quantitative transaction. 
The software tried to predict the k-line diagram based on several models and algorithms.
Based on the latest data, it would recognize if the point was a signal point that showed trading signal, and made trading actions in time.

# Algorithm Optimization
One algorithm was to analyze the accelerations and the trends of the bollinger bands.
My teammates would run the algorithm on past long-term data with several sets of coefficients. 
With the trading signals results from API, I would extract all the signal points and trading points to do analysis.
(better interest rates, greater # of significant profits, cross-coefficient comparison)

# Scripts

## crossingCheck
cross-check the coefficients

## signalCoefficient
extract all the signal points and trading points

## downloadData
get and save data from API to local
